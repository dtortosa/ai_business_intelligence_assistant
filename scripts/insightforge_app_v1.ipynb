Enhance Customer Satisfaction: Since customer satisfaction levels are decent but not exceptional, focus on improving the overall customer experience. This could involve providing excellent customer service, addressing any issues or concerns promptly, and seeking feedback from customers to identify areas for improvement.\\n\\n5.

Existing literature predominantly emphasizes the technological \\naspects of AI implementation in business models (BMs), treating BMI as a byproduct. Additionally, there is a lack \\nof coherent understanding regarding the scope of BMI propelled by AI.

On the other hand, a low unemployment rate can indicate a strong economy with higher consumer confidence, leading to increased spending and potentially higher sales for retailers.\\n\\nRetailers need to closely monitor the unemployment rate as it can directly impact their sales performance. By analyzing this factor along with other market-driving factors like fuel prices, temperature, holidays, human resources, and geographical location, retailers can make informed decisions to optimize their sales strategies and resource allocation to meet customer demands effectively.
