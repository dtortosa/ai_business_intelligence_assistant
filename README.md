# AI-powered Business Intelligence Assistant for Organizations

This project was developed in the context of the Advanced Generative AI bootcamp from Purdue University as a capstone project. 

Its main goal is the development of AI agent able to provide insights and recommendations based on the analysis of sales data from the organization along with additional private data and external sources.

This has been mainly achieved by prompt-engineering and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). I have developed several AI tools dedicated to the different tasks including data analysis, retrieval of relevant documents related to sales (FAISS vector database), Wikipedia searches and plotting of trends. The agent is able to used them depending on the request. In addition, this project also includes the evaluation and monitoring of the agent. It includes an option to test the predictions of the model against the ground truth and monitor the execution time.

All of this has been implemented in a app generated with Streamlit. This app allows the user to explore the different functionalities developed in this project.
